  ### What is httpush?
  httpush is a simple Python script that utilizes threading to quickly create and send POST requests over the net!
  <br>
  ### Why httpush?
  You should use httpush because it only requires Python, the Requests module and a connection to the net!
  <br>
  <br>
  ### How do I setup httpush?
  Setting up httpush is extremely simple!
  Go to ![Python.org](https://www.Python.org) and download the latest stable edition of Python, then install Python with the installer you installed.
  After you installed Python, go to the the terminal then run these commands,
  ```bash
  python --version
  pip --version
  ```
  If none of them commands yielded an error then type this command,
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

  After installing the requests module, go to the Python terminal then run this command,
  ```python
  import requests
  print(requests.__version__)
  ```
  If this command didn't yield an error then install the latest main.py release from the ![releases](https://github.com/crLea/httpush/releases) tab. 
  <br>
  Then you should be able to run the script and use httpush!
  It seems daunting to download Python but it isn't hard!
  
  <br>
  If you have issues downloading Python don't create issues, it has nothing to do with my app!!
